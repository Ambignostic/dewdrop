Dewdrop
=======

Dewdrop makes writing complex WordPress plugins simpler by providing a 
sensible project layout and developer tools.


Quick Start
-----------

### Step 1

Download and install the latest release of WordPress <http://wordpress.org/latest.zip>

### Step 2

Run the Dewdrop installer script from within the root folder of your WordPress installation:

    php <(curl -sS https://raw.github.com/DeltaSystems/dewdrop/master/installer)


Testing and style
-----------------

Unit tests are greatly appreciated.  We aim to have over 90% code coverage and 
high-quality, relevant tests.  We also value integration tests to help us ensure
that Dewdrop-based plugins continue working reliably with new WordPress releases.
Code should be written to conform with PSR-2 style.
