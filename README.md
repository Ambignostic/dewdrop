Dewdrop
=======

Dewdrop makes writing complex WordPress plugins simpler by providing a 
sensible project layout and developer tools.


Quick Start
-----------

0. Download and install the latest release of WordPress <http://wordpress.org/latest.zip>
0. Run a magical script to create a new plugin with the Dewdrop libraries and dependencies in place


Testing and style
-----------------

Unit tests are greatly appreciated.  We aim to have over 90% code coverage and 
high-quality, relevant tests.  We also value integration tests to help us ensure
that Dewdrop-based plugins continue working reliably with new WordPress releases.
Code should be written to conform with PSR-2 style.
